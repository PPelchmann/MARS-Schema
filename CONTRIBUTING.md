# Contributing to the MARS-Schema project

## How to contribute

We are encouraging you to support the further development of MARS by actively contributing to the project. Also we are happy if you join the discussion. Following we will describe the processes to engage with this project:

### GitHub Issue for "minor" requests

Please use the [GitHub Issue Feature](https://github.com/arago/MARS-Schema/issues) for logging a new request or submitting a suggestion, like adding single Nodetypes or Subtypes. We will take care of the issue as soon as possible. 

Please take your time to review existing, open issues and tell us what you think about these requests.

### GitHub Fork/Pull mechanism for extending the schema

The GitHub Fork mechanism provides a way to synchronize the whole repository to a users local repository, creating a local 'branch'. The user then can perform local changes to a large extend. If the user decides to synchronize her/his changes back to the 'master' reposity, (s)he can issue a 'pull' request, that will by checked by the maintainer and, in case all or some of the changes are of general interest, can be merged back to the public 'master' repository. 

Please review the [GitHub Documentation on Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for more information about this approach.

Feel free to use the [Github Fork/Pull mechanism](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) if 
you want to contribute by changing the XML schema directly (pls. use only [MARSSchema2013.next.xsd](schemas/MARSSchema2013.next.xsd) for that purpose). We will review and discuss the requested extension and come back to you.

If you have any kind of question please contact us at <mars@arago.de> .

## What to contribute

Please see our MARS Wiki for a list of current nodetypes and attributes. The most commonly requested extensions for MARS are classes and subclasses.
